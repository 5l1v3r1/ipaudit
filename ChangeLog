ipaudit 1.0
Sep 4, 2004
-  Resumed development on ipaudit (binary-only).  Previously the ipaudit binary
   development was carried along in the ipaudit-web branch.  Now the intention
   is to keep the branches separate and have ipaudit-web require ipaudit.
   For changelog info betwen Jan 19, 2001 and now see ipaudit-web changelog.

-  ipaudit:  Removed obsolete(?) DLT_LINUX from pcap ethernet types.  Fixed
   Daemon mode bug caused by misuse of waitpid() and pause().

ipaudit 0.95

Jan 19, 2001
-  ipaudit:  corrected for packet double count / double write
               when packets travels between two monitored interfaces.

             devices.

             Use of select() to implement multiple reads
             fixes exit problem in a different way from yesterday.

Dec 20, 2000
-  ipaudit: fixed ihandler() to exit cleanly (no more core dumps?) by
   using fcntl() to set interface file descriptor to O_NONBLOCK
-  ipstrings: fixed handling of DLT_NULL packet type (needed to
   at 'PacketOffset' to 'caplen'

Dec 10, 2000
-  ipaudit: expand '-l' (local) option to allow more flexible ip ranges.
-  ipstrings:  add '-z' (size) to print ip packet size.

   in printed source port field.
-  ipaudit: add 'I' option to dump all traffic from a single IP address.
-  ipaudit: separate ipaudit distribution into ipaudit-bin (just C code)
   and a future ipaudit-web (cron and cgi scripts).  Currently
   cron and cgi scripts available in ipaudit-0.93b3.tgz

ipauidt 0.92
Jun 20, 2000
- print ethernet packets with -e option
- prevent memory overflow due to packet storms with -L option
- sort output by ip address or intial connection time if -t option.
- include total.c, ipstrings.c utilies in distribution, and
     assorted perl scripts - dnslist, ipf, icf (total utility replaces collate)
- fix reading of some devices such as ppp (add correct offset to ip packet structure)
- use separate structures for ip and eth packet cracking.
- hopefully removed code which made BSD OS not compile.
- Packet length no longer includes ethernet header
- correctly take into account ip header length (option field)
- debug option also prints version info, for easier debug reports
